# üëã About Me
Hi! I am Jiayue Pu(Êµ¶ÂòâË∂ä), a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), fortunately supervised by Prof. Xueqi Cheng and [Prof. Fei Sun](http://ofey.me/). My current research interest lies in Trustworthy Machine Learning, especially in Large Language Models and Machine Unlearning.

During my freshman year at university, driven by an intense passion for information security, I actively engaged in both practice and competitive events in Capture the Flag (CTF). As I progressed into my sophomore year, I transitioned my focus towards conducting research on the security implications of Large Language Models (LLMs). I am deeply passionate about the field of information security and firmly believe in the principle that "for every clever trick, there is a countermeasure that is even more ingenious." Committed to advancing the state of national information security, I am determined to contribute significantly to this crucial area.
